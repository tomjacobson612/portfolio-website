            <p>
              My name is Tom Jacobson and I am currently completing my master's
              degree in computer science at Portland State University, with a
              focus in software engineering. My previous background consists of
              a Bachelor of Business Administration from Western Washington
              University and time spent in retail management post graduation.
              <br />
              <br />
              I am fluent in Python and have intermediate experience with C++,
              C, Java, and Javascript. This website was designed using a
              combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Other projects I have
              worked on include a discord trivia bot, fake news prediction
              program, and a sudoku solving program that generates a random
              sudoku board using an API and solves the given board. Additionally
              the I designed a graphical user interface for the sudoku board so
              that the user can see the board before and after solving, as well
              as control when the solve function runs with the press of a
              button. These projects were written in Python. <br />
              <br />
              I am currently focused gaining professional experience and on
              finishing my degree (estimated graduation date June 2024). Below
              you will find a detailed work history, list of classes taken, and
              links to the aforementioned projects.
