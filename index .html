          <p class=>
            My name is Tom Jacobson and I am currently completing my master's
            degree in computer science at Portland State University, with a
            focus in software engineering. My previous background consists of a
            Bachelor of Business Administration from Western Washington
            University and time spent in retail management post graduation. </p> <br>
            <p> I am fluent in Python and have intermediate experience with C++, C, Java,
            and Javascript. This website was designed using a combination of
            HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Other projects I have worked on include a
            discord trivia bot, fake news prediction program, and a sudoku
            solving program that generates a random sudoku board using an API
            and solves the given board when a button is pressed. Each of those
            projects were written in python. </p> <br>
            <p>I am currently focused gaining professional
            experience and on finishing my degree (estimated graduation date
            June 2024). Below you will find a detailed work history, list
            of classes taken, and links to the aforementioned projects.</p> <br>
