My previous background consists of a Bachelor of Business Administration from Western Washington University and time spent in retail management post graduation. \n`
// let str2 = `During my time at Portland State I have learned a variety of different technologies. I would consider myself fluent in Python and have intermediate experience with C++, C, Java, and Javascript. This websited was designed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Other projects I have worked on include a discord trivia bot, fake news prediction program, and a sudoku solving program that generates a random sudoku board and solves it at the press of a button. Each of those projects were written in python. 
// As I finish my degree I look forward continue bringing that same drive and excitement for learning to my professional career. The ability create applications that solve a problem for the user, where previously something did not exist, is an amazing feeling. I look forward to utilizing that passion for development in my career outside of the classroom.
// I am currently focused gaining professional experience and on finishing my degree (estimated graduation date June 2024). Below you will find a brief history of my previous work and classes taken, as well as some links to projects I have worked on since beginning the computer science degree.`;
